# A QR code Demo page

This demo page showcases the evaluation of various QR code libraries. I've combined a separate document where you'll find the details of the libraries that were tested, as well as insights into their functionalities.

## The libraries used are: 

1. [react-qr-code](https://www.npmjs.com/package/react-qr-code)
2. [qrcode.react](https://www.npmjs.com/package/qrcode.react)
3. [next-qrcode](https://www.npmjs.com/package/next-qrcode)

## Libraries Not Included in Final Selection

Several other libraries were tested, but ultimately not included in the final website due to limitations in features or performance compared to the selected libraries.
